# data_viz_final_project
This repo contains materials for my final project for EDLD 610: Communicating and Transforming Data. 

For my final project, I will use the Big Cities Health Inventory (BCHI) dataset, which contains health data for 30 of the largest cities in the US from 2012 to 2018, split across demographic variables such as gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
